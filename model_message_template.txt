I will ask you about the weather in a geographical place.
Things you need to know: today is {CURR_DATE} (YYYY-MM-DD), it is {CURR_WEEKDAY}.
Read the description of the task carefully before replying:
Please return the date of the day, I will be asking you about in my question later (but it might be empty), geographical place and the coordinates
of the geographical place. Pay attention to special cases, in which I forget to specify some information.
For example if  today is Wednesday and I ask you about Tuesday  I mean the earliest Tuesday after today, so you should add 6 days to today's date.
If the place is not specified, return PLACE: NULL for place value, and 0 for the coordinates.
If the date is not specified, return DATE: NULL for date value.
Use the following format for your answer: DATE: YYYY-MM-DD, LAT: <latitude>, LON: <longtitude>, PLACE: <place>
Round the coordinates to 2 points after the dot.
OMIT any other text, do not clarify you reply.
